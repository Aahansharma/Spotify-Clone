This project is a Spotify clone created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the look and feel of Spotify’s music interface with a responsive layout, sidebar navigation, playlists section, and a functional music player UI. The main goal of this project is to practice front-end development, improve styling techniques, and learn how media players are structured on modern websites. JavaScript is used to control audio playback, update UI elements, and add basic interactivity. Although it doesn’t include backend features, this clone is a great foundation for understanding how music-streaming front-end systems work.
